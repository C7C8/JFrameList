#JFrameList
JFrameList is a small utility written in Java for psychology students. It
contains a library of important studies (selected for a certain anonymous group,
but others are welcome) that can be searched and selected from. Details of each
study, namely the principle researchers, year, abstract,and study focus, are
stored in XML file.

###Contributing/Suggestions
If you'd like to see another study added to the list or would like to
suggest/implement a feature or change, feel free to submit a pull request or
open a new issue.

###Todo
This list is provided as a general roadmap, not a complete list of upcoming
updates.

* Clean up the GUI.

###Misc
This project started as a combination utility for real usage and a test of my
Java skills (I learned Java recently). Certain elements of the code may not fit
with accepted Java standards and conventions; feel free to submit an issue about
how to improve the code if you wish.
